Instructions about how to install and configure the PeppyMeter plugin with Volumio on a Raspberry.

First of all the suggestion is to start with a freshly installed Volumio, via factory reset or by installing it on a fresh card.

For a lot of activity you'll need an SSH access to the volumio, to do so go to
```
http://volumio.local/dev/
```
And enable SSH access (third button from the top), you'll get no feedback but test the connection from a Windows (or Mac or Linux) command prompt by connecting to volumio:
```
ssh volumio@volumio.local
```
The system will ask if to trust the raspberry key and then asks for a password, that is the default:
```
volumio
```

This is the expected result:
```
PS C:\Users\xxx> ssh volumio@volumio.local
The authenticity of host 'volumio.local (192.168.178.123)' can't be established.

Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes

After installation the first step is to configure your Raspberry to manage the LCD screen. In a typical scenario you'll see a gibberish screen but this is due to the fact that you need to configure the raspberry paramaters to support the specific screen.
